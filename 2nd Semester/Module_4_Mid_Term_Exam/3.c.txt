// Why do we need ->

-> operator overcome an amazing limitation of the dot operator. The dot operator can only access the members of the object that are public. The -> operator can access all members of the object.

-> is the sort form of (*). So, if we have a pointer to an object, we can use -> to access the members of the object.


char name[] = "My Name";

Person* p = new Person(20, 5.4, name);

cout << (*p).age << p->age << endl;
cout << (*p).height << p->height << endl;
cout << (*p).name << p->name << endl;
