// Explain Stack and Heap memory.

Stack is a data structure in a memory where data store with a common rule Last In First Out (LIFO). Memory assign on compile time. it's fixed size.

int main()
{
 
  int a;
}

Heap is a data structure in a memory where data location generate on runtime. Heap memory is allocated and de-allocated by a programmer. if a programmer can organize memory very well then there will no memory leak issue happen. on demand we can resize or extend the memory.

int main()
{
   int *ptr  = new int[10];
}
