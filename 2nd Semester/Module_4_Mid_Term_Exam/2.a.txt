class is a blueprint or template for creating objects with pre-defined properties and methods. 

class Person {
    public:
        int age;
        char* name;
};

object is a instance of a class that has properties and methods. 

from the top example, Person is a class and if we create an instance of it, it would be an object.

Person p;




Person p;
p.age = 10;
char name[] = "My Name";
p.name = name;

cout << p.age << " " << p.name << endl;

// output: 10 My Name
