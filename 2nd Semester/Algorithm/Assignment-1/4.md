# Calculate the time complexity of the following code snippets  

## (a)

```cpp
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = n; i > 0; i /= 2){
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j+=5){
            count += 1;
        }
    }
```

the time complexity of this code is O(nlogn) because the inner loop is decreasing by half every iteration so complexity is logn. and the outer loop is incrementing by 5 so the complexity is n

so the total complexity is O(nlogn).

## (b)

```cpp
    for(int i =1; i*i<n; i++){
        cout << “hello”;
    }
```

the time complexity of this code is O(sqrt(n)) because the loop is increasing by square every iteration so complexity is sqrt(n).

so the total complexity is O(sqrt(n)).

## (c)

```cpp
    for(int i =1; i<n; i=i*2){
        for(int j=1; j*j<n; j+=2){
            cout << “hello”;
        }
    }
```

the time complexity of this code is O(nlogn) because the inner loop is increasing by 2 every iteration so complexity is n/2 or n. and the outer loop is incrementing by double so the complexity is logn

so the total complexity is O(nlogn).

## (d)

```cpp
    int m = 1;
    for(int i=0; m<=n; i++){
        m+=i;
    }
```

the time complexity of this code is O(sqrt(n)) because the loop is increasing by 1 but the value of its condition value is increasing by it's previous vale with i every iteration. so complexity is sqrt of n.

so the total complexity is O(sqrt(n)).
