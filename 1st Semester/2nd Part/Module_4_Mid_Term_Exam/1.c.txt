to create a integer variable in heap
int* a = new int;
*a = 10;
cout << *a << endl;

to create a float variable in heap
float* c = new float;
*c = 10.5;
cout << *c << endl;

to create a char variable in heap
char* b = new char;
*b = 'a';
cout << *b << endl;

to create a integer array in heap
int* d = new int[10];
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    d[i] = i + 1;
}
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    cout << d[i] << " ";
}

the benefits of using dynamic memory is 

    1.  Heap can be used to create a variable of any size and it can be used to create a variable of any type
    2.  Memory is allocated in any random order.
    3.  Manually Memory Allocation and De-allocation by the programmer.
    4.  Memory resizing is possible and flexible
