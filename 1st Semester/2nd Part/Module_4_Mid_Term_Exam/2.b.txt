// what is constructor in oop
a constructor is a special method that is used to initialize a newly created object and is called just after the memory is allocated for the object.

constructor method name is same as the class name.


#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Person {
public:
    int age;
    char* name;

    Person(int a, char* n) {
        age = a;
        name = n;
    }
};


int main() {

    Person p(20, "My Name");

    cout << p.age << " " << p.name << endl;

    return 0;
}
