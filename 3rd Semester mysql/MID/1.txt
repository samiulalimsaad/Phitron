A primary key and a composite primary key are both used in relational databases to uniquely identify records within a table.

Primary Key:
   A primary key is a single column or attribute within a table that is designated as the unique identifier for each row in that table.
   It ensure that each value in the primary key column is unique and not null.
   A primary key is used to establish relationships between tables through foreign keys.
   It provides a simple and straightforward way to identify records uniquely.

Composite Primary Key:
   A composite primary key consists of two or more columns or attributes that combined and act as the unique identifier for each row in a table.
   It is used when no single column can uniquely identify rows, but a combination of columns can.
   The combination of columns in a composite primary key must be unique, but individual columns may not be unique by themselves.
   Composite primary keys are often used in situations where the data's uniqueness depends on multiple attributes.
